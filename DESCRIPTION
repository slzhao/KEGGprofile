Description: KEGGprofile is an annotation and visualization tool which
    integrated the expression profiles and the function annotation in KEGG
    pathway maps. The multi-types and multi-groups expression data can be
    visualized in one pathway map. KEGGprofile facilitated more detailed
    analysis about the specific function changes inner pathway or temporal
    correlations in different genes and samples.
